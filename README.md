The usefulness of this repo is somewhat lessened due to the Arch Arm armv7 repo being a broken mix of old and new packages.  

I've switched to Devuan on my Chromebook.  
But if I release any new kernels they will likely still be Arch packages.  

I might create .debs for some of the other packages like uboot etc. But then again I might not.
